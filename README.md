In this DrRacket library, I intend to write fuctions that perform all basic **algebraic** manipulations to the [American] high-school level, at least.

### Project structure:

  * Start with directory for each axiom
    * Create .rtk files and write code that gets that axiom functioning
  * Merge axiom files into core axioms.rtk file in the project's root directory.
  * Find a better way to organize the files


### About the name:

* The Science of Restoring What is Missing and Equating Like With Like
    * *Hmm. "SORWIMAELWL" That won't work.*
      * The Science of Restoring What is Missing and Equating Likes
        * S O R W I M A E L W L
          * Sorwimael
            * *Ha! that works!*
            * (pronounce [/soɻwɪmaeɫ/](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:IPA "Wikipedia:IPA - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia"))

This is a translation of the title of an old book, "['الكتاب المختصر في حساب الجبر والمقابلة](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compendious_Book_on_Calculation_by_Completion_and_Balancing)" by the mathematician [al-Ḵwārizmī](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muḥammad_ibn_Mūsā_al-Khwārizmī). It was his treaste on Algebra.
